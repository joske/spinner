# Implement a simple spinner on the console

This was 'inspired' by the code in a Dreams Of Code video where he did the same in GoLang.

My horror grew with every passing second. Go is just completely horrible. So I decided to prove to myself
that I could write a better version in Rust in short time.

With this version, it's impossible to start a spinner twice, to start a stopped spinner, or to stop a not started spinner, enforced by the Compiler.
